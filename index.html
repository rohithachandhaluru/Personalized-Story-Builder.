In the <adverb> village of <village name>, three animals lived near the forest: a strong <Animal 1>, a clever <Animal 2>, and a wise <Animal 3>. They were friends with two villagers, <Person 1> and <Person 2>.

One hot summer, the river that gave water to the village started to dry up. The villagers were worried because without water, their crops wouldn’t grow. <Person 1> and <Person 2> decided to find a new source of water. Their animal friends wanted to help.

They walked deep into the forest and faced many problems. The ground was rough, and the sun was hot. The <Animal 2> found a tall tree and climbed it to look for water. “I see a river far away!” the <Animal 2> shouted.

They were happy, but the river was blocked by fallen trees and big rocks. The <Animal 1> used his strength to clear the way, while the <Animal 3> flew ahead to make sure they were safe.

After hours of hard work, they finally reached the river. They dug a small path for the water to flow back to <village name>. Slowly, the water returned to the village. The people cheered and thanked their brave friends.

<Person 1> smiled and said, “We did it by working hard and never giving up!”

Moral: When we work together and don’t give up, we can solve even the hardest problems.
